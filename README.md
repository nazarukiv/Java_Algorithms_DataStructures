# java algorithms and data structures

This repo is for me to practice algorithms and data structures and track which one I did already.
I ask AI to create me list of tasks for specific topic and solve them, later on asking feedback and improving my answers.
My main goal is to get all fundamentals perfectly and being able to solve more complex tasks later.
